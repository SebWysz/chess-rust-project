### Overview: 
We are trying to implement chess in Rust using the Bevy game engine.  
Mostly coded by Sebastian with a little help from Samuel.
Currently, pieces can move around and turns are implemented.
Move the pieces by clicking the piece and then clicking a red tile that the piece can move to, and make sure it is the correct color's turn.
Currently working on a check implementation by creating an array structure that stores the game.

### Missing Features to be implemented
En passant  
Check Mate (just an indicator)  
Stalemate (same as above)  
Pawn Promotion  
Dragging pieces (instead of only clicking to move)  

### Bugs 
Weird bug that the red signalling tiles don't appear correctly if you resize the window.
