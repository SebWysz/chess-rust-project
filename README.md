##### Introduction: 
We are going to implement chess in Rust. Goals for this project include working with UI and registering mouse clicks
and drags. Also it will include many class definitions and how classes can interact with each other. We wanted to work on this
project because we like to play chess, and it would be only appropriate to include it in our coding project.

##### Technical Overview:  
Checkpoint 1:
Set up the board to look somewhat aesthetically pleasing with a checker pattern.  
Have pieces that look like the chess pieces i.e. knight looks like a horse.  
Implement the pieces' ability to move.  
Include a turn function so one person can't move twice in a row.  

Checkpoint 2:
Make sure the pieces can only move how they can in chess (can't drag them to any square).  
Include castling and en passant.  
Make the game end in a stalemate when the king has no legal moves and is not in check.  
Make the game end in a win/loss when the king has no legal moves and is in check.  

If parts of these checkpoints aren't complete, we leave the time after checkpoint 2 to make up for lost progress.  
If we happen to be on schedule, we may look into a timer function for each player's moves.  

##### Possible Challenges: 
Learning how to work with a UI in Rust.  
How objects interact with each other.  
How to display the board and working with user mouse input.  

##### Currently Missing Features
En passant  
Check  
Check Mate  
Stalemate  
Pawn Promotion
