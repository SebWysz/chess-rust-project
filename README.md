### Overview: 
We are trying to implement chess in Rust using the Bevy game engine.  
Currently, pieces can move around and turns are implemented.
Move the pieces by clicking the piece and then clicking a red tile that the piece can move to, and make sure it is the correct color's turn.
Currently working on en passant, castling, and pawn promotion.  

If you can figure out the bug listed, contact me because currently, I have no clue.  

### Missing Features to be implemented
En passant  
Castling
Check Mate (just an indicator)  
Stalemate (same as above)  
Pawn Promotion  
Dragging pieces (instead of only clicking to move)  

### Bugs 
Weird bug that the red signalling tiles don't appear correctly if you resize the window.
